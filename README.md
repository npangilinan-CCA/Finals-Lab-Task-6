# [Finals Lab Task 6 - MongoDBCRUD](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20244038/pangilinan_MongoDB.Practice.Task.docx)

This task focuses on performing fundamental MongoDB operations such as creating a database, inserting documents, and executing find, update, search, and delete actions within a collection.

## Step by Step Process

### Create a Database
- Start by creating or switching to a specific database
- The selected database becomes the active workspace for all upcoming operations

### Insert Documents
- Within the database, a collection is created
- Multiple documents are inserted into the collection, each containing structured data fields such as name, age, or address

### FIND Documents
- Display all documents stored in the collection
- Use filters to find specific documents based on certain values like name or ID

### UPDATE Documents
- Locate the document that needs modification using a condition (e.g., name or ID)
- Specify the field(s) to be changed and apply the update
- Confirm the update by checking the document again

### SEARCH Documents
- Use specific criteria to locate documents that match particular conditions (e.g., age greater than a value or status equals a specific string)
- Review the matched results for accuracy

### DELETE Documents
- Identify the document(s) to be removed using a condition
- Remove the document(s) from the collection
- Verify deletion by checking the collection contents
